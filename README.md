Example implementation of Andrid Account Manager

I started out looking into [Account Manager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html), but I struggled to understand it without a full example. I was happy when I found [SamuGG](https://github.com/SamuGG/android-account-manager-example). My demo app is a simplification of his implementation.

It only supports registering of a new account, and you need to delete the account manually under "accounts" to reset to state.
